Bank Statement Reconciliation Summary
=====================================

The Bank Reconciliation Summary shows how your actual bank statement balance
and the balance of the bank account in Odoo match, after taking into account
any unreconciled items.

This report is useful if your bank account's statement balance and balance
in Odoo do not match, and you need to check for duplicate or manually created
transactions that might cause the discrepancy.

This report was created, inspired by Xeroâ€™s bank reconciliation summary,
https://help.xero.com/Report_BankRec, and from a basic explanation of the
bank statement reconciliation summary:
http://www.accountingcoach.com/bank-reconciliation/explanation.


Usage
=====

#. Go to *Accounting / Reports / OCA accounting reports / Bank Statement Reconciliation*
#. Enter the end date for your analysis, the bank journal and the actual bank
   balance at that date.

The report displays the following sections:

* Balance in Odoo
* Plus Outstanding Payments - payments in odoo not yet reconciled
* Less Outstanding Receipts - payments in odoo not yet reconciled
* Plus Un-Reconciled Statement Lines - statement lines not yet reconciled
* Statement Balance

If the theoretical Statement Balance does not match with Odoo, it will
display the Computed (theoretical) balance, the Actual Balance and
the Unencoded Statement Amount.
